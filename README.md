First repo [education] and such

Self-described Swiss Army knife developer. I feel that technology will be the answer to the human race's questions and problems, and we as developers will be the interface for that answer. Therefore it is our obligation to learn as much as possible to that end and always remind ourselves that every language is not a hammer and every problem is not a nail.
